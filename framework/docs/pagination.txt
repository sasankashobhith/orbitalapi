Pagination Implementation Notes:

1. Define a class that implements PageHandler interface. Say the name of the class is MyPageHandler.
2. In the BLModule @BEndpoint annotation add field pageHandlerClass=MyPageHandler.class.
3. In the BLModule method make sure to take MyPageHandler as a method parameter.
4. Make sure BLModule method returns null.
5. API implementing pagination must support 2 queries:
	Get all IDs for the requested data.
	Get data for a list of IDs.
6. In the BLModule method make sure to run appropriate query and set data IDs (List<Long>) in MyPageHandler.
7. For an API request the method PageHandler.getFullDataIDs is called first time. 
   For every subsequent page PageHandler.getDataFromIDs is called.
8. With every pagination response an HTTP Response Header "bundee-api-pg-token" is set. Client must send this in HTTP Request Headers.
9. VehicleModule.listVehicles has sample implementation.
10. There's a SQL script that creates pagination table, that MUST be run. framework\dbscripts\bundee_pagination_ddl.sql
